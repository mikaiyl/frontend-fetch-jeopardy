Now it's time to use `fetch()` to make some GET requests and do something semi-intelligent with the responses. 

### :warning: Read the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page first.

### MVP

1. Review the documentation for [jService, an open "Jeopardy" API](http://jservice.io/). Experiment a little and see what data you can get back.
2. Use jService when a page loads to retrieve a question and present it to the user. (5 points)
3. Provide the user an input box for supplying an answer, and a button for making a guess. (5 points)
4. When the user makes a guess, check if the user-supplied answer is the correct answer.
5. Award points (based on the "difficulty") to the user if they guess the answer correctly. (5 points)
6. Load a new question for the user. (5 points)
7. You do not have to provide a win condition.

### Stretch Goal
1. Use OOD (Object-Oriented Design) to represent the contestant and a round.

### Epic Mode
1. Provide the user with a timer and penalize them for not guessing correctly in time.
2. Only show the contestant one question per difficulty in a given category.
3. Provide a win condition once all questions in all categories are exhausted.
